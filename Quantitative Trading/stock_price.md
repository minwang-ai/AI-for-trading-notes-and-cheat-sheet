## Stock
### What it is: 
An asset that represents fractional ownership in a company.  
- Companies split their stock into N shares; if you own one share of company stock and you own 1/N of the company as a shareholder.
### Purpose: 
Companies issue stock to raise funds for expansion, debt repayment, etc.
### Limited liability: 
as a shareholder (whether you own common or preferred stock), your financial risk is limited to the amount of money you invested in the stock.
- **Example**: If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders are not responsible for paying the company’s debts. The worst thing that can happen to a shareholder is losing the amount they invested in the stock.

### Three types of securities
---
| Category                | Equity Securities               | Derivative Securities                     | Debt Securities                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **What It Is**           | Represents the ownership in a company’s net value <br> (equity = assets - debts)                               | Financial contracts, where its value is derived from other assets (like stocks, bonds, or commodities)     | A loan to a company or government                  |
| **Types**                | Common stock, Preferred stock, Private Equity (non-publicly traded) | Options (call and put options), Futures  | Bonds     |
| **How It Works**         | **Stock**: Shareholders own part of the company, may earn from dividends or by selling the stock at a higher price. <br>**Private Equity**: Investors own shares in private companies, aiming for long-term growth (e.g., through IPO or acquisition). | **Options**: give buyer the right, but no obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a fixed price (strike price) before the contract expires. <br> **Futures**: obligate the buyer and seller must buy and sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified expiration date in the future. | Lenders lend money to the company/government, earn regular interest, and get the loan amount back at maturity.        |
| **Price Volatility**     | **Common stock:** Highly volatile—prices can rise or fall significantly <br> **Preferred Stock:** Less volatile—dividends are fixed. <br> **Private Equity:** Event-driven very high volatility—illiquidity and uncertain valuation; price is not affected by daily market but by company performance over time. | Highly volatile—depends on the price movement of the underlying asset      | Less volatile, typically offer fixed returns   |
| **Risk Level**           | **Common stock:** Medium to high risk—depending on the company's performance and market conditions. <br>**Key Risks**: If the company performs poorly, the stock price could drop significantly. In the event of bankruptcy, common stockholders are last to be paid, so you could lose up to 100% of your investment.<br> **Preferred Stock:** Low to medium risk—fixed dividends <br>**Key Risks**: Still subject to company bankruptcy. Preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders but after debt holders. You could lose up to 100% of your investment if the company goes bankrupt.<br> **Private Equity:** Very high risk—illiquid (unpredictable valuation, long lock-in periods, no quick exit strategy); returns take years and are not guaranteed. <br> **Key Risks**: If the private company fails or goes bankrupt, you may lose 100% of your investment. There is no liquid market to sell shares, and it could take years to see returns due to long lock-in periods before the company is sold or goes public. | **Options:** Medium risk—capped at the premium you pay to enter the contract (limited, lower than the cost of owning the stock outright). <br> **Key Risks**: If the market doesn’t move as expected (e.g., stock price doesn’t rise for a call or fall for a put), you only lose the entire premium paid. <br>**Futures:** High risk for both parties—high leverage and obligatory nature of the contract. <br>**Key Risks**: Unlimited losses possible. Both parties must buy or sell even if the price moves against you, and losses can exceed the initial margin or deposit, resulting in you losing more than your initial investment. | **Bonds:** Low to medium risk—usually receive regular interest payments, and bondholders are generally paid before stockholders in the event of bankruptcy. Government bonds are typically safer than corporate bonds due to lower default risk. <br>**Key Risks**: If the issuer defaults, you might lose interest payments or even principal. |
| **Potential Returns**    | **Common Stock:** Buy low, sell high (capital gains) + possible distribution of the company profit (dividends). <br> **Preferred Stock:** Fixed dividends. <br> **Private Equity:** Returns come from capital appreciation when the company is sold, acquired, or goes public (IPO). No regular dividends; profit depends on company success over time. | **Call option:** Potential profit when the price rises above the strike price. <br> **Put option:** Potential profit when the price falls below the strike price. <br> **Futures:** Profit or loss depends on the price of the underlying asset at the contract's expiration. | Regular interest payments (usually low) + return of principal at maturity.                                               |
| **Key Benefits**         | **Common Stock:** Can provide high returns if the company grows. <br> **Preferred Stock:** Fixed dividend payments with less volatility. <br> **Private Equity:** Potential for large returns if the company grows or is sold.                    | **Options:** Flexibility to buy or sell at a fixed price without obligation. <br> **Futures:** Locks in prices and protects buyers/sellers from extreme market volatility.                                                     | Fixed, stable, regular returns; safer investments                                                                       |
| **Ownership**            | **Yes.** <br> **Common Stock:** Ownership stake in the company with voting rights. <br> **Preferred Stock:** Ownership with a fixed income stream but without voting rights. <br> **Private Equity:** Ownership with significant influence or control over the company’s operations through board seats or agreements (no traditional voting rights). | **No.** Only contracts based on the value of underlying assets.                                                                                                                         | **No.** Just a lender, not a shareholder                                                                                  |

### Example for Securities with Price Fluctuation Scenarios
1. **Equity Securities:**
 - **Common Stock**

    Scenario: 
    You own 100 shares of Apple stock at $150 per share. <br>
    Price Increase: If Apple’s stock price rises to $180, you could sell the shares and profit $30 per share (capital gains), resulting in a total profit of $3,000 (100 shares x $30).<br>
    Price Decrease: If Apple’s stock price drops to $120, your shares lose value. You would have a paper loss of $3,000 if you sold them at this lower price.
 
 - **Preferred Stock**

    Scenario: 
    You own 100 shares of Preferred stock in a company, each paying a fixed dividend of $5 per share annually.<br>
    Price Fluctuations: Preferred stock is less volatile. Whether the company’s stock price rises to $120 or drops to $80, you still receive your fixed dividend of $500 per year (100 shares x $5 dividend).<br>
    Price Drop: Even if the stock price drops significantly, you still receive dividends, but the value of your shares could fall if the company faces trouble.
 
 - **Private Equity**

    Scenario: You invest $50,000 in a startup through private equity.<br>
    Company Growth: If the startup becomes successful, your investment could grow significantly. For example, if your stake is worth $200,000 after 5 years, you've made a 4x return.<br>
    Failure: If the startup fails, you could lose your entire $50,000 investment since private equity investments are illiquid and high-risk.

2. **Derivative Securities:**
 - **Call Option (Right to Buy)**

    Scenario: You buy a call option on Tesla stock with a strike price of $500 and pay a $10 premium for 100 shares.<br>
    Price Increase: Tesla’s stock rises to $600. You exercise your option and buy 100 shares for $500 each. You sell them at $600, making a $10,000 profit (before subtracting the $1,000 premium).<br>
    Price Decrease: Tesla’s stock stays below $500. You do not exercise the option, and you lose only the $1,000 premium paid.

 - **Put Option (Right to Sell)**

    Scenario: You buy a put option on Apple stock with a strike price of $150, paying a $5 premium for 100 shares.<br>
    Price Decrease: Apple’s stock falls to $120. You exercise your option and sell 100 shares for $150 each, making a $3,000 profit (before subtracting the $500 premium).<br>
    Price Increase: Apple’s stock stays above $150. You don’t exercise the option, and your maximum loss is the $500 premium.

 - **Futures**

    Scenario: You enter a futures contract to buy 100 barrels of oil at $70 per barrel in 3 months.<br>
    Price Increase: If the price of oil rises to $90 per barrel, you buy at $70, making a $20 profit per barrel ($2,000 total).<br>
    Price Decrease: If the price drops to $60 per barrel, you are still obligated to buy at $70, leading to a $10 loss per barrel ($1,000 total).

3. **Debt Securities:**
 - **Bonds**

    Scenario: You buy a corporate bond for $10,000 with a 5% annual interest rate, maturing in 10 years.<br>
    Price Stability: You receive $500 interest annually, and at the end of 10 years, you get back the $10,000 principal.<br>
    Risk of Default: If the company goes bankrupt, there’s a risk that you may not receive the full amount of interest or principal.
