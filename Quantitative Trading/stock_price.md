## Stock
### What it is: 
An asset that represents fractional ownership in a company.  
- Companies split their stock into N shares; if you own one share of company stock and you own 1/N of the company as a shareholder.
### Purpose: 
Companies issue stock to raise funds for expansion, debt repayment, etc.
### Limited liability: 
as a shareholder (whether you own common or preferred stock), your financial risk is limited to the amount of money you invested in the stock.
- **Example**: If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders are not responsible for paying the company’s debts. The worst thing that can happen to a shareholder is losing the amount they invested in the stock.

### Three types of securities
---
| Category                | Equity Securities               | Derivative Securities                     | Debt Securities                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **What It Is**           | Represents the ownership in a company’s net value <br> (equity = assets - debts)                               | Financial contracts, where its value is derived from other assets (like stocks, bonds, or commodities)     | A loan to a company or government                  |
| **Types**                | Common stock, Preferred stock, Private Equity (non-publicly traded) | Options (call and put options), Futures  | Bonds, Certificates of Deposit(CDs)     |
| **How It Works**         | **Stock**: Shareholders own part of the company, may earn from dividends or by selling the stock at a higher price. <br>**Private Equity**: Investors own shares in private companies, aiming for long-term growth (e.g., through IPO or acquisition). | **Options**: give buyer the right, but no obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a fixed price (strike price) before the contract expires. <br> **Futures**: obligate the buyer and seller must buy and sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified expiration date in the future. | Lenders lend money to the company/government/bank, earn regular interest, and get the loan amount back at maturity.        |
| **Price Volatility**     | **Common stock:** Highly volatile—prices can rise or fall significantly <br> **Preferred Stock:** Less volatile—dividends are fixed. <br> **Private Equity:** Event-driven very high volatility—illiquidity and uncertain valuation; price is not affected by daily market but by company performance over time. | Highly volatile—depends on the price movement of the underlying asset      | Less volatile, typically offer fixed returns   |
| **Risk Level**           | **Common stock:** Medium to high risk—depending on the company's performance and market conditions. <br>**Key Risks**: If the company performs poorly, the stock price could drop significantly. In the event of bankruptcy, common stockholders are last to be paid, so you could lose up to 100% of your investment.<br> **Preferred Stock:** Low to medium risk—fixed dividends <br>**Key Risks**: Still subject to company bankruptcy. Preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders but after debt holders. You could lose up to 100% of your investment if the company goes bankrupt.<br> **Private Equity:** Very high risk—illiquid (unpredictable valuation, long lock-in periods, no quick exit strategy); returns take years and are not guaranteed. <br> **Key Risks**: If the private company fails or goes bankrupt, you may lose 100% of your investment. There is no liquid market to sell shares, and it could take years to see returns due to long lock-in periods before the company is sold or goes public. | **Options:** Medium risk—capped at the premium you pay to enter the contract (limited, lower than the cost of owning the stock outright). <br> **Key Risks**: If the market doesn’t move as expected (e.g., stock price doesn’t rise for a call or fall for a put), you only lose the entire premium paid. <br>**Futures:** High risk for both parties—high leverage and obligatory nature of the contract. <br>**Key Risks**: Unlimited losses possible. Both parties must buy or sell even if the price moves against you, and losses can exceed the initial margin or deposit, resulting in you losing more than your initial investment. | **Bonds:** Low to medium risk—usually receive regular interest payments, and bondholders are generally paid before stockholders in the event of bankruptcy. Government bonds are typically safer than corporate bonds due to lower default risk. <br>**Key Risks**: If the issuer defaults, you might lose interest payments or even principal.<br> **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):** Low risk—Losses are rare with insured CDs. <br>**Key Risks**: If the bank defaults and your CD isn’t insured, you could lose your deposit. Additionally, if interest rates rise, the fixed rate on your CD could become unattractive. If inflation rises, the fixed rate on a CD might lose purchasing power over time. |
| **Potential Returns**    | **Common Stock:** Buy low, sell high (capital gains) + possible distribution of the company profit (dividends). <br> **Preferred Stock:** Fixed dividends. <br> **Private Equity:** Returns come from capital appreciation when the company is sold, acquired, or goes public (IPO). No regular dividends; profit depends on company success over time. | **Call option:** Potential profit when the price rises above the strike price. <br> **Put option:** Potential profit when the price falls below the strike price. <br> **Futures:** Profit or loss depends on the price of the underlying asset at the contract's expiration. | Regular interest payments (usually low) + return of principal at maturity.                                               |
| **Key Benefits**         | **Common Stock:** Can provide high returns if the company grows. <br> **Preferred Stock:** Fixed dividend payments with less volatility. <br> **Private Equity:** Potential for large returns if the company grows or is sold.                    | **Options:** Flexibility to buy or sell at a fixed price without obligation. <br> **Futures:** Locks in prices and protects buyers/sellers from extreme market volatility.                                                     | Fixed, stable, regular returns; safer investments                                                                       |
| **Ownership**            | **Yes.** <br> **Common Stock:** Ownership stake in the company with voting rights. <br> **Preferred Stock:** Ownership with a fixed income stream but without voting rights. <br> **Private Equity:** Ownership with significant influence or control over the company’s operations through board seats or agreements (no traditional voting rights). | **No.** Only contracts based on the value of underlying assets.                                                                                                                         | **No.** Just a lender, not a shareholder                                                                                  |
