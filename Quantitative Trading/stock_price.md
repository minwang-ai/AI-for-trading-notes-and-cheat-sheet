## Stock
### What it is: 
A fractional ownership in a company. 
- Companies split their stock into N shares; if you own one share of company stock and you own 1/N of the company as a shareholder.
### Purpose: 
Companies issue stock to raise funds for expansion, debt repayment, etc.
### Limited liability: 
as a shareholder (whether you own common or preferred stock), your financial risk is limited to the amount of money you invested in the stock.
- **Example**: If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders are not responsible for paying the company’s debts. The worst thing that can happen to a shareholder is losing the amount they invested in the stock.
