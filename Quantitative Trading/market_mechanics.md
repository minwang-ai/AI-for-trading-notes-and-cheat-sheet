# Market Mechanics
## Stock Trading

### Stock Market
The stock market functions as a platform where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold.  
When a company first goes public by issuing stocks to raise capital in an Initial Public Offering (IPO), it sells shares directly to the public for the first time in what is called the primary market. The initial value of its stock is based on metrics like revenue, profits, and assets. Once the IPO is complete, trading takes place in the secondary market, where stock prices are primarily driven by supply and demand, reflecting how much people are willing to pay for the stock.

### How Trade Occurs
Demand for a stock is determined by the number of orders placed and the prices buyers are willing to pay (bid price) versus the prices sellers are asking for (ask price). The difference between the bid and ask prices is known as the bid-ask spread. Buyers and sellers submit orders with specific price limits, and when a match is found between a buyer and seller, a trade is executed.

### Two Order Types
- **Market Orders**: Executed immediately at the current market price. They are ideal for traders who prioritize speed over price precision, but they may not get the best price, especially in volatile markets.
- **Limit Orders**: Allow traders to specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell. The trade only occurs if the stock reaches the specified price. This gives the trader control over the execution price, but the trade may not happen if the price doesn’t reach the set limit.

### Important Roles
* **Market makers** are financial institutions, like Citadel Securities, that continuously offer to buy or sell stocks at publicly listed prices. They facilitate trades by stepping in to provide liquidity, ensuring that trades can occur even when there isn't an immediate buyer or seller. Market makers earn profits through the bid-ask spread—buying stocks at a lower price and selling them at a slightly higher price. While they take on some risk, their role is essential for maintaining smooth market operations and ensuring liquidity.
    * **Liquidity** refers to how easily an asset can be traded at a stable price—without causing significant price fluctuations.
        * Cash is considered the most liquid asset because it can be readily exchanged for other assets. However, currency values can fluctuate, making cash worth more or less over time, much like stocks.
        * Highly liquid stocks, like Apple, are frequently traded, allowing large volumes to be bought or sold with minimal impact on price.
        * Illiquid stocks, such as penny stocks, are traded infrequently, making it harder to execute trades at consistent prices.
    * **Example:** If you want to sell a large number of Apple shares, a market maker can step in to buy them, preventing a sharp drop in price due to excess supply.
* **Stock exchanges**, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), serve as the central platform where trading takes place. The exchange records and displays the last traded price of a stock, which serves as an indicator of its current market value. Stock exchanges ensure that all trades are executed fairly, efficiently, and transparently.

### Buy Side and Sell Side
In financial markets, buy side and sell side are terms used to describe two distinct groups that participate in stock trading. These labels do not indicate whether someone is exclusively buying or selling, but rather describe the role of the market participant in the transaction.
#### Buy Side
* The buy side consists of investors and institutions that seek to buy or sell assets (such as stocks and bonds) for investment purposes on behalf of their clients or shareholders. These participants aim to maximize returns on their investments by making informed decisions based on asset analysis.
* Examples:
    * **Individual investors**
    * **Institutional investors** such as mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds
#### Sell Side
* The sell side facilitates transactions by assisting buyers and sellers with trades or by stepping in as counterparties to provide liquidity. Unlike the buy side, the sell side does not invest for long-term returns; instead, it earns profits through fees, commissions, or the bid-ask spread.
* Examples:
    * **Market Makers:** Firms that provide liquidity by buying and selling securities, ensuring that trades can happen even when there is no immediate buyer or seller.
    * **Brokers:** Intermediaries that execute trades on behalf of the buy side (clients) and charge a commission for doing so.
    * **Investment Banks:** Banks that assist companies with raising capital through IPOs and bond issuance, facilitate large financial transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and may operate trading desks to offer market-making services.


### Global Trading and Arbitrage
Stocks can be listed and traded across multiple markets globally. For instance, HSBC shares trade in both New York and Hong Kong. While the same stock may trade at slightly different prices in different markets due to supply and demand, significant price discrepancies typically resolve quickly.
* **Arbitrage:** Traders can exploit small price differences across markets —buying a stock in one market at a lower price and selling it in another market at a higher price, capitalizing on market inefficiencies.
