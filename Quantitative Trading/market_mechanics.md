# Market Mechanics
## Stock Trading

### Stock Market
The stock market functions as a platform where shares of publicly traded companies are bought and sold.  
When a company first goes public by issuing stocks to raise capital in an Initial Public Offering (IPO), it sells shares directly to the public for the first time in what is called the primary market. The initial value of its stock is based on metrics like revenue, profits, and assets. Once the IPO is complete, trading takes place in the secondary market, where stock prices are primarily driven by supply and demand, reflecting how much people are willing to pay for the stock.

### How Trade Occurs
Demand for a stock is determined by the number of orders placed and the prices buyers are willing to pay (bid price) versus the prices sellers are asking for (ask price). The difference between the bid and ask prices is known as the bid-ask spread. Buyers and sellers submit orders with specific price limits, and when a match is found between a buyer and seller, a trade is executed.

### Two Order Types
- **Market Orders**: Executed immediately at the current market price. They are ideal for traders who prioritize speed over price precision, but they may not get the best price, especially in volatile markets.
- **Limit Orders**: Allow traders to specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell. The trade only occurs if the stock reaches the specified price. This gives the trader control over the execution price, but the trade may not happen if the price doesnâ€™t reach the set limit.

### Important Roles
- **Market Makers**: Financial institutions, like Citadel Securities, that ensure liquidity by constantly offering to buy or sell stocks at publicly listed prices. They help facilitate trades by providing shares even if there is no immediate buyer or seller available. Market makers earn profits through the bid-ask spread, charging slightly higher prices to sell stocks than what they pay to buy them. They take on some risk, but their role is crucial for keeping the market liquid and efficient.
- **Stock Exchanges**: Stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), act as the central platform where trading takes place. The exchange records and displays the last traded price of a stock, which provides an indicator of its current market value. Stock exchanges ensure that all trades are carried out fairly, efficiently, and transparently.
